config CAN_VCAN
	tristate "Virtual Local CAN Interface (vcan)"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  Similar to the network loopback devices, vcan offers a
	  virtual local CAN interface.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called vcan.

config CAN_DEBUG_DEVICES
	bool "CAN devices debugging messages"
	depends on CAN
	default N
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want the CAN device drivers to produce a bunch of
	  debug messages to the system log.  Select this if you are having
	  a problem with CAN support and want to see more of what is going
	  on.

config CAN_MSCAN
	depends on CAN && (PPC || M68K || M68KNOMMU)
	tristate "Support for a Freescale MSCAN based chips"
	---help---
	  The Motorola Scalable Controller Area Network (MSCAN) definition
	  is based on the MSCAN12 definition which is the specific
	  implementation of the Motorola Scalable CAN concept targeted for
	  the Motorola MC68HC12 Microcontroller Family.

config CAN_MPC52XX
	tristate "Freescale MPC5200/MPC5121 onboard CAN controller"
	depends on CAN_MSCAN && (PPC_MPC52xx || PPC_52xx || PPC_MPC5121)
	default LITE5200
	---help---
	  If you say yes here you get support for Freescale MPC5200/MPC5121
	  onboard dualCAN controller.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called mpc52xx_can.
